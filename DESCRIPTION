Description: Reproductive biology analysis is a methodological package developed to carry out the
    analyzes of the article: Salas-Singh et al. (2022) to describe updated information on the basic
    reproductive biology of a bullseye puffer Sphoeroides annulatus females and potential use of the
    gonadosomatic index as input data to assess length at 50% maturity and identify the breeding season. 
    Also to verify the maturity patterns of the analysed data assessed by single and
    double sigmoid models, including the selection of the most suitable model. 
    For this purpose, some functions and a vignette were created to explain 
    the process step by step. The tables and figures were personalized.
